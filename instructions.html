    <h1>Thank You for Completing the Quiz!</h1>
    <p>We appreciate your time and effort in learning about sextortion prevention and intervention strategies.</p>

    <p> You might have noticed that a file has been downloaded after submitting the quiz. Send that to the person who sent you this and you will be provided a script of the things that she assumes you need to be taught</p>
    <p>You're now ready to continue. In this study, you will be randomly assigned to one of two learning paths: either a version of your own voice will be cloned to deliver the lesson, or you’ll be taught using a random voice on the site. Your participation is voluntary, and all data is handled with strict confidentiality. There are no right or wrong paths — just different ways to experience the content. Click the “Next” button below to proceed and follow the instructions on the next page carefully.</p>
